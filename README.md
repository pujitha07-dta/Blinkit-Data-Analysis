**BLINKIT DATA ANALYSIS**

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Blinkit dataset using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI.
The goal is to explore trends, patterns, and insights through data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and dashboard creation.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI

**📂 Project Workflow**


Data Collection & Loading – Imported Blinkit dataset into Jupyter Notebook.

Data Preprocessing – Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and structured the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for:

Distribution analysis

Correlation mapping

Trend identification

Statistical insights

Visualization in Power BI – Built interactive dashboards to display:

Sales trends

Average ratings

Customer behavior patterns

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

**📊 Key Insights**


Identified patterns in sales and customer ratings.

Highlighted top-performing products and categories.

Discovered seasonal and regional trends.

Created a clear, visual summary of business performance in Power BI.

**🚀 How to Use**
